# Predicting Customer Churning with Logistic Regression

**Project Description:** In this project, I explore and analyze a dataset containing information about customers of a telecommunications company. Then, I build a logistic regression model to predict whether or not a customer will unsubscribe from the company, also known as "churning". 

To see an overview of the project, you can check out my write-up [here](https://johncarlomaula.github.io/project5_telco).

This project was originally a data analysis group project for a course I took in Fall 2019, *STAT 4620 - Introduction to Statistical Learning*, at OSU. For the purpose of my portfolio, I have redone the project with a focus on one classification method.

**Main Goals:**
- Perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset
- Build a model to predict customer churning and measure its performance
- Perform appropriate model validation
